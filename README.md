This project is an effort to create a blogging platform that fit's me perfectly. I often find that services like Blogger and Wordpress have limitation with regards to what you can and cannot do on you page, so I thought I would have a crack at trying to improve their model.

For now it exists as something that only I can contribute to. I put the words and images into a SQLite database manually and then extract them using Knex.js. What I am working towards is a service where a person can create their own login and then add blog posts to their own database. This is a while away, however.

Right now I am focusing on two areas.One is making the page about as seamless and easily navigatable as possible. I will not tolerate any glitches or non-responsiveness. I want it to work the same on every device and on every browser. The second is making the code itself as easily navigatable and changeable as possible is a big priority for me. I am focusing on removing every scrap of unnecessary code and providing in-line comments to make sure any third-party that wants to play around with my code has no problems doing so.
