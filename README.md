# art-viewer-second-try

Have a play! >>> http://anthonyartviewer.herokuapp.com/#/play <<<

This project gives artists a way to show potential clients how their art will look inside their home. It's a full-stack web app that uses a SQLite database to store the image data, and React and Redux to create its functionality.

There are a ton of directions I'd like to take this projects in. Among other things, in the future I am hoping to incorporate elements of Augmented Reality (AR) to make the user experience much more fluid and accurate, and make it a React Native downloadable application that could be used offline.
